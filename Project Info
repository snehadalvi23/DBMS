                                                         Food Canteen Management System
About the Project
This project is a Java + MySQL based Food Canteen Management System.
The idea was simple: canteen operations like taking orders, generating bills, and tracking inventory are usually manual and time-consuming. So, I built a system that automates all these tasks and makes the process faster and error-free.

I also explored an extension idea where students can:
Pre-order their food before arriving at the canteen
Select a time slot for pickup
Make payment in advance (UPI/online)
Store the UTR number (payment reference) in the database
The canteen staff can then verify the payment and serve the food directly → reducing waiting time

✨ What it Can Do
Take new food orders, update/cancel them if needed
Generate bills automatically with proper calculations
Keep track of food stock (inventory updates after every sale)
Allow admins to add/edit food items and monitor overall sales
Store everything securely in a normalized MySQL database using JDBC

🛠️ Tech Stack
Java (NetBeans IDE) – core application
MySQL – backend database
JDBC – connectivity between Java and MySQL
DBMS Concepts – normalization, schema design, queries

🗄️ Database Overview
Some main tables I designed:
users → login details of admins/cashiers
menu → list of food items, categories, prices
orders → order details (items + quantity, time slot if pre-order)
billing → transaction details (order id, amount, UTR number, date)
inventory → tracks available stock
